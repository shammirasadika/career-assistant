It is based on the concepts of ‘job’ and an ‘occupation’. ‘Occu pation’ is based on\nthe concepts of ‘skill level’ and ‘skill specialisation’.\nScope and unit of classification\nThe scope of OSCA is all jobs and occupations in the Australian labour market that are legal in at least one Australian state or territory. For\nexample, a job involving the sale and distribution of illegal narcotics is excluded.\nFor some occupations there is a legal requirement that persons employed in the occupation must be registered or licensed. Registration or\nlicensing ensures that the person has the necessary skills and knowledge to compe tently perform their job. It usually requires meeting\ncertain conditions such as specific qualifications, adhering to professional standards and/or codes of conduct, experience, and ongoing\nprofessional developme nt.\nOSCA excludes jobs which can only be undertaken as a volunteer receiving no pay or profit.\nThe unit of classification within OSCA is a ‘job’.\nJob\nA ‘job’ is a set of tasks designed to be performed by one person for an employer in return for pay or profit. This includes jobs undertaken\nvia self-employment and jobs undertaken for payment in kind. For example, monks solely provided with food, housing, and clothing are in\nscope of OSCA as these are considered payment in kind.\nOccupation\nAn ‘occupation’ is a group of jobs requiring the performance of highly similar sets of tasks. Task similarity is defined in terms of ‘skill level’\nand ‘skill specialisation’.\nSkill level\nAn occupation's skill level is determined by the range and complexity of the set of tasks performed. The broader and more complex the set\nof tasks, the greater the skill level of the occupation.\nSkill level refers to the requirements for compe tent performance of a set of tasks. It is measured operationally by considering the following\ndimensions:\nthe level or amount of formal education and training\nthe amount of previous experience in a related occupation\nthe amount of on-the-job training, and\npersonal attributes.\nFormal education and training refers to the level and amount of education and training required for compe tent performance of an\noccupation’s tasks. It is measured according to qualifications in the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF).\nPrevious experience is the time spent gaining relevant work experience. It is measured in months or years.\nOn-the-job training is the amount of training needed after starting work in a job. It is measured in months or years, and may be undertaken\nat the same time as formal education and training.\nPersonal attributes are an alternative way to assess skill level. They are used where the other three elements fail to accurately describe the\nskill level. Creativity, interest, physical fitness and sporting ability are commo n substitutes. For example, Occu pation 231131 Actor states\n‘High levels of creative talent, interest and personal commi tment may substitute for formal qualifications or years of experience’.\nSkill level is an attribute of jobs, not individuals. The skill level of an occupation is based on the requirements for compe tent performance of\nthe occupation’s set of tasks. For example, a job of laying bricks in mortar is classified to the occupation 'Bricklayer'. A person employed as a\nBricklayer may be highly skilled with post-trade qualifications and years of experience, or they may be inexperienced with no qualifications\nand low compe tence. In either case, the skill level of the occupation ‘Bricklayer’ is the same.29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0\nhttps://www.abs.gov.au/book/export/41460/print 2/1217", "section_hint": "Conceptual model"}

The assignment considers advice from employers, industry training bodies, professional\norganisations, and other stakeholders.\nEach skill level describes the general requirements. They do not specify particular qualifications or entry pathways. Some occupations\nrequire a specific level of formal education. For these occupations, years of experience cannot replace this requirement. For example,\ncompe tent performance of the tasks of Occu pation 262131 Chiropractor requires the knowledge delivered through a 3-year bachelor\ndegree followed by a master’s degree or a double degree in chiropractic science and clinical science. Registration with the Australian Health\nPractitioners Regulation Agency is also required.\nSkill Level 1\nSkill Level 1 occupations have a level of skill comme nsurate with an AQF Bachelor Degree or higher qualification. At least five years of\nrelevant experience may substitute for the formal qualification. In some cases, relevant experience and/or on-the-job training may be\nrequired in addition to the formal qualification.\nOccu pations at Skill Level 1 include: Civil Engineer, Compo ser, Cotton Grower, Mathematician, Nurse Practitioner, Paediatrician, Sales and\nMarketing Manager, Secondary School Teacher, and Software Engineer.\nSkill Level 2\nSkill Level 2 occupations have a level of skill comme nsurate with:\nAQF Diploma\nAQF Advanced Diploma, or\nAQF Associate Degree.\nAt least three years of relevant experience may substitute for the formal qualification. In some cases, relevant experience and/or on-the-job\ntraining may be required in addition to the formal qualification.\nOccu pations at Skill Level 2 include: Executive Assistant, General Duties Police Officer, Hotel or Motel Manager, ICT Customer Support\nOfficer, Medical Laboratory Technician, Office Manager, Plumbing Inspector, Post Office Manager, and Ship’s Officer.\nSkill Level 3\nSkill Level 3 occupations have a level of skill comme nsurate with:\nAQF Certificate III which includes at least two years of on-the-job training, or\nAQF Certificate IV.\nAt least three years of relevant experience may substitute for the formal qualification. In some cases, relevant experience and/or on-the-job\ntraining may be required in addition to the formal qualification.\nOccu pations at Skill Level 3 include: Automotive Electrician, Bookkeeper, Butcher, Dressmaker or Tailor, Early Childhood Educator, Electrical\nFitter, Firefighter, Hairdresser, Real Estate Agent, and Senior Beef Cattle Station Worker.\nSkill Level 4\nSkill Level 4 occupations have a level of skill comme nsurate with:\nAQF Certificate II, or\nAQF Certificate III.\nAt least one year of relevant experience may substitute for the formal qualification. In some cases, relevant experience may be required in\naddition to the formal qualification.\nOccu pations at Skill Level 4 include: Accounts Clerk, Assistant in Nursing, Bus Driver, Correctional Officer, Medical Receptionist, Miner,\nSecurity Officer, Sewing Machinist, Storeperson, and Waiter.\nSkill Level 5\nSkill Level 5 occupations have a level of skill comme nsurate with:\ncompu lsory secondary education, or29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0", "section_hint": "3OSCA's five skill levels"}

The apprenticeship:\nincludes at least two years of on-the-job training, and\nleads to a Certificate III.\nThis is an example of skill level needing both formal education and training and a period of on-the-job training.\nSkill specialisation\nSkill specialisation relates to the tasks required of an occupation. Skill specialisation is defined in terms of:\nfield of knowledge required\ntools and equipme nt used\nmaterials worked on, and\ngoods or services produced or provided.\nField of knowledge required is the subject matter knowledge that underpins an occupation. An example field of knowledge is ‘law’.\nTools and equipme nt used include plant, machinery, compu ter-based equipme nt and hand tools. It also includes intellectual tools and\nprocesses such as personal interaction, analysis, reasoning, and art and design techniques.\n‘Plant’ is large mobile or stationary equipme nt. Plant performs several related functions and is usually controlled by an internal operator.\n‘Machinery’ is stationary equipme nt which is not as large as plant. Machinery performs one processing function and is usually controlled\nby an external operator.\n‘Hand tools’ are small equipme nt moved and operated by one person.\nMaterials worked on include both tangible and abstract material. They are extracted, processed, transformed, refined or fabricated as part\nof an occupation. Examples of tangible materials worked on include wood, metal, and livestock. Examples of abstract materials include\naccounting data, text, relationships and organisations.\nGoods or services produced or provided are the end products of the set of tasks performed by an occupation. They include physical goods,\npersonal or other services, and abstract products like software and blogs.\nIllustrative example of skill specialisation\nExample 3: 281331 Solicitor\nThe main tasks of the occupation Solicitor show that the:\nfield of knowledge is law\ntools and equipme nt used are intellectual tools (research) and personal interaction (interviews, pleading cases)\nmaterials worked on include text and information, and29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0\nhttps://www.abs.gov.au/book/export/41460/print 4/1217", "section_hint": "AQF Certificate I."}

For example, Sub-major Group 89 Other Labourers refers to all jobs in Major Group\n8 that are not classified within the following Sub-major Groups:\n81 Cleaner and Laundry Workers\n82 Construction and Mining Labourers\n83 Factory Process Workers\n84 Farm, Garden and Forestry Workers, or\n85 Fast Food Cooks and Food Preparation Assistants.\nSimilarly, Occu pation 462699 Sportspersons nec refers to all jobs within Unit Group 4626 Sportspersons which are not elsewhere included\nin the following Occu pations:\n462631 Footballer\n462632 Golfer, or\n462633 Jockey.\nOSCA 2024 v1.0 contains 86 ‘not elsewhere classified’ (nec) occupations.\nEach residual group is part of the OSCA structure used to classify jobs that do not meet design constraints (/statistics/classifications/osca-\noccupation-standard-classification-australia/2024-version-10/osca-structure#design-constraints) for example, Harbour Master. These\ngroups of jobs may be listed within each nec occupation.\nSupplementary identifiers\nIdentifiers ending in zero are used to process responses which cannot be coded to an occupation, but can be coded to a major, sub-major,\nminor or unit group. These are called ‘not further defined’ (nfd) identifiers. For example, a response of ‘Internal Medicine Specialist’ is not\ndetailed enough to be classified to any occupation. It can be coded to Unit Group 2643 Physicians which compr ises all internal medicine\nspecialists. The ‘Internal Medicine Specialist’ response is coded to supplementary identifier 264300 Physicians, nfd.\nIdentifiers comme ncing with a ‘0’ (for example 099888 ‘Inadequately Described’) are used to process and store responses which do not\ncontain sufficient information to be coded to any part of OSCA. These supplementary identifiers are also used for responses which are\noutside of the scope of OSCA such as ‘housewife’, ‘pensioner’ and ‘student’.\nSupplementary identifiers are not part of the OSCA structure. They exist for operational reasons only. No responses would be coded to\nthese identifiers if sufficient information or information within the scope of the classification was available.\nDesign constraints\nThe design of OSCA is informed by three constraints – statistical balance, statistical feasibility, and mutual exclusivity.\nStatistical balance\nStatistical balance ensures groups at the same level in OSCA have similar numbers of jobs. Statistical balance exists to minimise large\nvariations in relative standard errors as large relative standard errors result in suppressing data produced by sample surveys.\nMeaningful groups of jobs may not result if statistical balance is the only consideration. For example, groups of jobs which are growing at a\nfaster rate than all other groups of jobs in the classification, or which represent large numbe rs of jobs but which cannot be meaningfully\nsplit may not be separately identified.\nStatistical balance is achieved by applying ideal size ranges for each level of the classification. The ideal size ranges specify the ideal\nminimum and maximum numbe r of employed persons that should be classified to each of OSCA’s five levels. The ideal size range for each\nof OSCA’s five levels and a specialisation is shown in the below table.29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0", "section_hint": "11Residual groups"}

Other data\nsources were given less emph asis as they can be less reliable. For example, the numbe r of membe rs of an association is of limited value\nbecause:\nemployed persons can belong to multiple associations\nmembe rship does not guarantee the membe r is working in a job associated with the occupation, and\nmany retirees maintain their membe rship of an association after they cease employment.\nThe ideal size range was used for most groups of jobs in OSCA. Some groups of jobs are below the ideal minimum size. This is because\nthese groups cannot be meaningfully combined (for example, Unit Group 1213 Legislators). Other groups exceed the ideal maximum size.\nIn many cases, these groups cannot be meaningfully disaggregated (for example, Unit Group 2654 Registered Nurses, Occu pation 273333\nSoftware Engineer).\nStatistical feasibility\nStatistical feasibility refers to whether meaningful data can be compiled. It considers whether the information typically provided in source\ndata, such as the Census of Population and Housing or Labour Force Survey, is sufficiently detailed to enable accurate classification.\nStatistical feasibility ensures OSCA only includes an occupation for which data can be produced. For example, there may be more than 300\nemployed persons in Australia undertaking the tasks of a fertility nurse. A separate occupation cannot be created if most of these\nemployed persons state their main occupation is ‘nurse’, their tasks are ‘nursing’, the goods or services they produce or provide are ‘health’\nand their industry of employment is ‘health’.\nMutual exclusivity\nMutual exclusivity ensures that each job is classified to one, and only one, group of jobs at each level of the classification with no overlaps. It\nmeans that OSCA can be applied without ambiguity to every job in the Australian labour market.\nOSCA establishes mutual exclusivity through the set of tasks associated with the occupation. Individual tasks may be undertaken by\nmultiple occupations. However, each occupation’s set of tasks is unique to the occupation and not performed by any other. The set of main\ntasks listed for each occupation in OSCA has been defined to be unique. This ensures the mutual exclusivity of all occupations.\nFor example, the set of tasks for the occupations Carpenter and Bricklayer involve reading and interpreting plans and erecting structures.\nHowever, the main tasks for Carpenter also include using nails to erect structures made of wood and similar materials, while the main tasks\nfor Bricklayer involve erecting structures made of bricks and mortar. These occupations are mutually exclusive because each has a unique\nset of tasks.\nThe design constraint of mutual exclusivity means that separate occupations cannot be identified in OSCA if the set of tasks are essentially\nthe same. For example, registered nurse jobs in acute care are classified to Occu pation 265432 Registered Nurse (Acute Care). Whether the\njob is in a private or public hospital makes no difference as the jobs perform the same main tasks.

A solution is required to classify a job whose tasks relate to more\nthan one OSCA occupation. The job should be classified according to the following order of precedence.\n1. Where the tasks of the job relate to different OSCA skill levels, the job is classified to the occupation at the higher skill level. For example,\na job involving driving a truck (Occu pation 713131 Truck Driver (General) – OSCA Skill Level 4) and loading and unloading the truck\n(Occu pation 891131 Freight Handler (Rail or Road) – OSCA Skill Level 5) is classified to Occu pation 713131 Truck Driver (General).\n2. Where the tasks of the job are at the same skill level, but relate to different stages of the production and distribution process, the tasks\nrelated to the production stage take priority. For example, a job involving assisting with propagating plants (Occu pation 842231\nHorticultural Nursery Assistant – OSCA Skill Level 5) and selling plants (Occu pation 631131 Sales Assistant (General) – OSCA Skill Level 5)\nis classified to Occu pation 842231 Horticultural Nursery Assistant.\n3. Where the tasks are at the same skill level and at the same stage of production, the job is classified according to the amount of time\nspent on each set of tasks. For example, a job involving assembling and installing fire doors, door frames and fittings (Occu pation\n372131 Carpenter and Joiner – OSCA Skill Level 3), and installing and connecting electrical wiring to ensure that the door closes\nautomatically when a fire alarm sounds (Occu pation 381231 Electrician (General) – OSCA Skill Level 3) is classified to Occu pation 372131\nCarpenter and Joiner if the job requires the most amount of time spent on these tasks.\nApprentices or trainees\nOSCA classifies occupations according to the requirements for compe tent performance of a set of tasks. Most apprentices or trainees\nperform the same tasks as those performed by an employed person who is not an apprentice or trainee, but under varying degrees of\nsupervision and at varying levels of competence. The skill of an apprentice or trainee nearing completion of their training is, generally,\nsignificantly higher than on day one of their training.\nOSCA does not include separate occupations for apprentices or trainees. For example, apprentice carpenters or trainee hairdressers are\nclassified to Occu pations 372132 Carpenter and 392132 Hairdresser, respectively.\nSupervised practice or provisional registration\nSome professions require newly or overseas qualified employed persons, or those returning to the profession after a significant absence to\nwork under an experienced supervisor to ensure compe tent performance. These arrangements, referred to as supervised practice or\nprovisional registration, confirm that the occupant of a job has the required skills (level and specialisation) to compe tently perform the\nrequired set of tasks. They are commo n for professions such as law, medicine, nursing, psychology and teaching. For example, a newly\ngraduated lawyer must be supervised for 18 months to 2 years by another lawyer who works at the same practice who holds a practising\ncertificate. A new graduate from a psychology course needs provisional registration to undertake a supervised internship before achieving\ngeneral registration as a psychologist.\nPersons employed via such arrangements perform the same tasks as those performed by the person supervising them. Therefore, OSCA\ndoes not include separate occupations for jobs undertaken via supervised practice or provisional registration. For example, graduate\narchitects or provisionally registered psychologists are classified to Occu pations 241131 Architect and 261231 Psychologist, respectively.\nDefence force occupations\nDefence force roles which have a civilian equivalent are classified to the relevant civilian occupation. For example, the army role Recovery\nMechanic is classified to Occu pation 713132 Tow Truck Driver. Similarly, Nursing Officer is classified to Occu pation 265499 Registered\nNurses nec.\nDefence force roles for which there is no civilian equivalent are classified to one of four specific defence force occupations: 121232 Defence\nForce Senior Officer, 149231 Commi ssioned Defence Force Officer, 149431 Senior Non-commi ssioned Defence Force Membe r, and 451131\nDefence Force Membe r – Other Ranks. For example, the navy role Boatswain’s Mate is classified to Occu pation 451131 Defence Force\nMembe r – Other Ranks.\nManagement, senior managers, middle managers, and supervisors / team leaders\nManagement\nManagement occupations classified to Major Group 1 are distinguished from other occupations based on whether the predominant or\nmost frequent tasks performed relate to planning, organising, directing, controlling and coordinating an organisation, or specific functions29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0\nhttps://www.abs.gov.au/book/export/41460/print 16/1217", "section_hint": "Treatment of specific cases"}

This includes not only specific functional roles but also high-level executive positions such as CEOs and General\nManagers who have overall control of the entire organisation. These roles require a compr ehensive understanding of the organisation’s\nstrategic goals and the ability to lead and manage diverse teams to achieve these objectives. The primary field of knowledge for these\noccupations is ‘management and leadership’ which includes strategic planning, high level decision-making, resource allocation, and\nperformance management.\nIn many cases, management jobs will have a secondary field of knowledge that is required to perform the role compe tently, and which is\nnot readily transferable to other management roles. If the occupation requires a secondary field of knowledge, that field of knowledge is\nused to classify the occupation to a ‘specialist’ management occupation in Sub-major Group 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17.\nFor example, the primary field of knowledge for the Occu pation 131131 Construction Project Manager is ‘management and leadership’ as\nthe main tasks performed are related to planning, organising, controlling and coordinating the construction functions of the organisation\nthey work for. The secondary field of knowledge is ‘construction’ as the occupation also requires qualifications and/or extensive experience\nin construction related activities.\nSenior managers\nOccu pations classified in Sub-major Group 12 Chief Executives, General Managers and Legislators are usually senior managers in\norganisations that are large enough to have a hierarchy of managers. The main characteristics of chief executives and general managers is\nthat they coordinate and direct the activities of other managers who have a range of specialised functions, and that they report to a board\nof directors. This is a result of the management and governance arrangements of organisations and reflects the complexity of the\norganisation’s functions as much as its size.\nMost occupations classified in Sub-major Group 16 Hospitality and Retail Managers are in relatively small organisations that do not usually\nhave hierarchies of managers. Although many shop managers are responsible for running relatively small establishments, the managers of\nlarge supermarkets and department stores are still shop managers. They are classified with other shop managers in Unit Group 1621 Retail\nManagers.\nJobs classified in Sub-major Groups 11 Business Administration and Promotion, and ICT Managers, 13 Construction, Production and\nDistribution Managers, 14 Education, Health, Welfare and Other Specialist Managers, 15 Farmers and Farm Managers and 17 Office\nAdministration and Service Managers may be employed in large hierarchical organisations or in relatively small organisations that provide\nspecialist services to other organisations.\nThe size of the organisation where a manager is employed is irrelevant when determining the most appropriate occupation. This is because\nMajor Group 1 is organised by skill specialisation, not by the size of the organisation managed. To classify a job to Major Group 1, both the\njob title and the main tasks or duties performed need to be considered.\nWhere an occupation’s primary field of knowledge is management, and the skill level is 1 or 2, the occupation will be classified to Major\nGroup 1.\nMiddle managers\nMiddle management occupations are regarded as the level of management imme diately below senior managers.\nWhere the predominant tasks of a middle management occupation are related to management and the skill level is 1 or 2, the occupation is\nincluded in Major Group 1, with their secondary field of knowledge determining the appropriate ‘specialist’ management occupation in Sub-\nmajor Group 11, 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17.\nWhere the primary tasks of a middle management occupation are related to another field of knowledge and the skill level is 1, the\noccupation is included in Major Group 2 Professionals. For example, the primary task of the Occu pation 211131 Accountant (General) is\nundertaking accountancy work, even though the occupation usually includes some management responsibilities. Accordingly, the\noccupation is included in Major Group 2 Professionals.\nWhere the primary tasks of a middle-management occupation are not management related, and the skill level is not 1, the occupation is\nclassified to the major group that best reflects its primary skill specialisation and skill level. For example, an Automotive Technician\n(General) whose primary role is repairing motor vehicles but also has management responsibility for organising and coordinating the\nfunctions of the business, will be classified to 351131 Automotive Technician (General).\nSupervisors / team leaders\nManagers have responsibility for the operations of an organisation or specific functions within an organisation. Supervisors and team\nleaders are only responsible for supervising staff, and often undertake the same main tasks as those they are supervising.29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0", "section_hint": "17within the organisation.

The main tasks of\nsupervisors and team leaders are generally the same as those they supervise, with supervision of staff being a minor part of their job. In\nsome cases, these supervisory or team leader roles have been created as a specialisation of the occupation.\nFor example, Cabin Supervisor (Aircraft) is a specialisation of the Occu pation 461731 Flight Attendant. The skill level and main tasks of a\ncabin supervisor are largely the same as a Flight Attendant, with some additional supervisory responsibility.\nThere are exceptions to this convention. Where the supervisor or team leader role requires a higher level of skill than those they are\nsupervising, or where the main tasks of the supervisory role are different to those they supervise, a separate occupation has been created.\nSupervisory occupations have been created for sectors such as:\naged and disability services (for example Aged Care Team Leader)\nagriculture and horticulture (for example Aquaculture Supervisor, Senior Beef Cattle Station Worker, Senior Broadacre Crop Farm\nWorker, Vineyard Supervisor)\nconstruction (for example Civil Construction Leading Hand)\nearly childhood services (for example Early Childhood Education Room Leader), and\nhospitality (for example Bar Supervisor, Cafe or Restaurant Supervisor, Gaming Supervisor)\nWhere the size of the supervisory occupation meets the minimum ideal threshold, it has been included in a separate unit group to the\noccupations supervised to ensure the unit group is at a single skill level. However, where it does not meet the minimum threshold, the\nsupervisory occupation was included in the same unit group as the occupations supervised.\nManagers and operators of small businesses\nSelf-employed workers who operate their own business either independently or with the assistance of a small numbe r of other workers will\noften undertake some management and administrative tasks. Such jobs are only classified to Major Group 1 Managers if the main\ncompo nent of the job is management of the business and supervision of staff.\nFor example, a hairdresser who owns and operates their own salon and employs a small numbe r of other hairdressers and a receptionist\nbut spends most of their time cutting and styling hair is classified to Occu pation 392132 Hairdresser. If, on the other hand, most of their\ntime is spent running the salon and hiring and supervising employees then that job is classified to Occu pation 172431 Hair or Beauty Salon\nManager.29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0\nhttps://www.abs.gov.au/book/export/41460/print 18/1217", "section_hint": "Supervisors and team leaders are generally classified to the same occupation as the most-skilled workers they supervise.

These include 232335\nHeritage Consultant (specialisation Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Surveyor), 244331 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\nLand and Sea Ranger, and 461632 Tour Guide (specialisation Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tour Guide).

ISCO was\nfirst published in 1958 with revised versions produced in 1968, 1988 and 2008. The main aims of ISCO are to provide a basis for\ninternational compa risons of occupation statistics between membe r countries and to provide a conceptual model for the developme nt of\nnational occupation classifications.\nThe current edition, ISCO-08, uses skill level and skill specialisation as criteria in the conceptual framework for the classification. Four broad\nskill levels are used, defined in terms of the educational categories and levels that appear in the International Standard Classification of\nEducation 1997 published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. ISCO-08 is currently being revised. The\nILO aims to make the revised classification available in time for implementation in 2030.\nThe following table indicates the numbe r of categories at each level of OSCA 2024 v1.0 and ISCO-08.\nHierarchical Level OSCA 2024 v1.0 ISCO-08\nMajor Group 8 10\nSub-major Group 53 43\nMinor Group 111 130\nUnit Group 421 436\nOccupation 1,156 -\nThe occupation level is not defined in ISCO-08 as it is expected that individual countries will develop this level of detail to suit their\nrequirements.\nThe following table compa res the major group titles for OSCA 2024 v1.0 and ISCO-08. It does not provide a correspondence between the\ntwo classifications. The detailed relationship between OSCA and ISCO-08 is contained in the correspondence tables between OSCA and\nISCO-08 available from Data downloads (/statistics/classifications/osca-occupation-standard-classification-australia/2024-version-10/data-\ndownloads) .\nOSCA 2024 v1.0 ISCO-08\n1 Managers 1 Managers\n2 Professionals 2 Professionals\n3 Technicians and Trades Workers 3 Technicians and Associate Professionals\n4 Community and Personal Service Workers 4 Clerical Support Workers\n5 Clerical and Administrative Workers 5 Services and Sales Workers\n6 Sales Workers 6 Skilled Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Workers\n7 Machinery Operators and Drivers 7 Craft and Related Trades Workers\n8 Labourers 8 Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers\n9 Elementary Occupations\n0 Armed Forces Occupations\nThe ten major groups in ISCO-08 are broadly similar to the eight major groups in OSCA 2024 v1.0. The most significant differences at major\ngroup level are:\nISCO-08 identifies Skilled Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Workers as a separate major group (Major Group 6). OSCA 2024 v1.0 includes\nFarmers and Farm Managers as a sub-major group in Major Group 1 Managers; Skilled Animal, Agricultural and Horticultural Workers as\na sub-major group in Major Group 3 Technicians and Trades Workers; and Farm, Forestry and Garden Workers as a sub-major group in\nMajor Group 8 Labourers.\nISCO-08 Major Group 3 Technicians and Associate Professionals has no equivalent in OSCA 2024 v1.0.\nOSCA 2024 v1.0 Major Group 4 Commu nity and Personal Service Workers has no equivalent in ISCO-08.\nISCO-08 Major Group 7 Craft and Related Trades Workers is largely compa rable to OSCA 2024 v1.0 Major Group 3 Technicians and\nTrades Workers except for Sub-major Group 31 Building, Engineering, ICT and Scientific Technicians.\nISCO-08 Major Group 9 Elementary Occupations is largely compa rable to OSCA 2024 v1.0 Major Group 8 Labourers.\nIn ISCO-08, jobs held by membe rs of the armed forces are included in Major Group 0 Armed Forces. In OSCA 2024 v1.0, jobs held by\nmembe rs of the armed forces are classified with their civilian equivalents, where these exist, or to one of four defence force specific\noccupations – 121232 Defence Force Senior Officer, 149231 Commi ssioned Defence Force Officer, 149431 Senior Non-commi ssioned\nDefence Force Membe r, and 451131 Defence Force Membe r – Other Ranks.29/09/2025, 13:41 OSCA - Occupation Standard Classification for Australia, 2024, Version 1.0\nhttps://www.abs.gov.au/book/export/41460/print 24/1217", "section_hint": "Comparison with ISCO-08"}
